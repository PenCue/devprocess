# The PenCue Development Process Documentation	

## **NOTE This a PUBLIC repository** - NO code or architecture documentation, just the development process. 

* [Requirements](#Requirements)
* [Deployment](#Deployment)
* [Development Process](#development-process)

## Requirements

- No requirements but [Typora editor app](https://typora.io/) is excellent to edit markdown pages

## Deployment

The process is kept simple since there is no way to "preview" the site until it is published.  

1. Create PR with updates
2. Get the PR reviewed 
3. Merge PR with "develop" branch to publish. 


## Development Process

The development process follows the [PenCue development process](https://github.com/pencue/devprocess)

Here's a quick summary:

* Assign issues you're working on to yourself.
* Work on a branch per issue, something like `issueno-name-of-feature`. One branch per feature/bug, please.
* File a PR early so it can be used for tracking progress.
* When you're finished, mark the PR for review by labelling with "Review &amp; Merge".
* Get someone to review your code, and assign to them; if no one is around, the project lead () can review.
